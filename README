A C++ genetic algorithm library. This code is super old and likely of little
use to anyone, however it was an indication that at some point in my life I
actually knew a little bit more about C++ than I do now, and I'd like to
remember that fact for later on when I've lost all comprehension of it again.

If this is of any use to you, let me know.
